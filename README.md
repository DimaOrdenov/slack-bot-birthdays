# slack-bots
There are some bots for [Slack](https://slack.com/) made using Python 3.

Now there are two bots:

[**birthdays-bot**](https://github.com/DimaOrdenov/slack-bots/tree/master/birthdays-bot) which made to inform managers about birthdays everyday and every last day of month. As it was made for organization list of colleges was made in Google Sheets. So thats the reason I've used Google Sheet API to connect to and get data from Sheet.

[**game-schedule-bot**](https://github.com/DimaOrdenov/slack-bots/tree/master/game-schedule-bot) which checks Google Sheet with game's schedule and notificate about them. This bot also made for organization and have restricted functionality as previous one. Google Sheet API also used here.
